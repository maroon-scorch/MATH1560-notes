# MATH 1560 Lecture Notes

Lecture notes for Professor Nicole Looper's **MATH 1560: Number Theory** at Brown University for the Spring 2022 semester. Professor Looper's **MATH 1560** was primarily split into two halves.:

1. The first half of the course covered familiar topics in Elementary Number Theory on unique factorizations, dirichlet convolutions, quadratic residues, etc. based on Chapter 1 to 5 of Ireland and Rosen's *A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory*. 

2. The second half of the course covered introductory topics in Algebraic Number Theory based on Chapter 1 to 5 of Stewart and Tall's *Algebraic Number Theory and Fermat's Last Theorem*. Specifically, this course first introduced Number Fields and Discriminants; then the ring of integers; showing that they are Dedekind Domains and proved unique factorization of ideals in said domain; proving the Dedekind-Kummer Theorem and basic properties of ramification theory; and talked about Fundamental Identities. Special topics in the Geometry of Numbers were also discussed in the end.
