% \section*{Introduction:}
\noindent Lecture $1$ to $11$ cover topics in Elementary Number Theory and are loosely based on Kenneth Ireland and Michael Rosen's \textit{A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory} \cite{ireland_rosen_2011}. The last section of Lecture $11$ and remaining lectures cover selected topics in Algebraic Number Theory and are loosely based on Chapter $1$ to $6$ of Stewart and Tall's \textit{Algebraic Number Theory and Fermat's Last Theorem} \cite{stewart_tall_2020}.
