% \section*{Introduction:}
\noindent These are lecture notes from \textbf{MATH 1560: Number Theory} with Professor Nicole Looper at Brown University for the Spring 2022 semester, with some supplemental materials written by the note-taker herself. The most up-to-date version of the notes are maintained in the note \href{https://github.com/maroon-scorch/MATH1560-notes}{repository}.\\

\noindent Lecture $1$ to $11$ cover topics in Elementary Number Theory and are loosely based on Kenneth Ireland and Michael Rosen's \textit{A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory} \cite{ireland_rosen_2011}. The last section of Lecture $11$ and remaining lectures cover selected topics in Algebraic Number Theory and are loosely based on Chapter $1$ to $6$ of Stewart and Tall's \textit{Algebraic Number Theory and Fermat's Last Theorem} \cite{stewart_tall_2020}.\\

\noindent These notes are taken by \href{https://github.com/maroon-scorch}{Mattie Ji} with gracious help and input from the instructor of this course. If you find any mistakes in these notes, please feel free to direct them via email to me or send a pull request on GitHub.\\

\noindent The notes are last updated \today.\\
